Critical Fixes
NONE

UX Ideas
- have SearchResult(s) close if cancel is pressed on initial search dialog cancel
- add datamessage to frmSearchResultPartner
- add Clone button to SearchResultPartner
- combine Forms table view with frmEditPokemon, use dropdown to select a form and fill that form's infromation into appropriate fields
- use cascade delete for pokemon and form entries, warn user about loss of associated partners and forms
- Add EV values to Pokemon table to make EV training eaisier

Optimization Ideas
- convert String names of stats to an enum in Partner classs
- combine Add/Edit forms to reduce code redundancy where possible
- frmSearchResultPartner and frmTraining uses the same buildPartner(row, row, row) function, move this to Partner class as a constructor and replace where needed
- condense Party highlight checks to single event, if possible
- add Pagination to SearchResult forms
